# automatic-birthday-greeter

No more forgetting the brithdays of the special people in your life! 

This app allows you to save the email of your loved ones that will be later on used for sending automatic birthday greetings! Thanks to smtplib module in Python this app is possible.

Here is how you can customize:		
    * Change the sender value to the email you want to use to send email
    * Change the password value.
    * Update the birthdays.cvs file with the information of the special people in your life.
    * When adding a new letter txt file, make sure to change the max value in the random.randint() for letter_num.
    * Use your email provider's smtp server address.

Disclaimer: This app was conceptualize by Dr. Angela Yu but the code is my personal approach to adding logic to the app.
